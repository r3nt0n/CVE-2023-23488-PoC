# CVE-2023-23488-PoC
Unauthenticated SQL Injection - Paid Memberships Pro &lt; 2.9.8 (WordPress Plugin)

Running this script against a WordPress instance with Paid Membership Pro plugin
tells you if the target is vulnerable.
As the SQL injection technique required to exploit it is Time-based blind, instead of
trying to directly exploit the vuln, it will generate the appropriate sqlmap command
to dump the whole database (probably very time-consuming) or specific chose data like
usernames and passwords.

Usage example:

```shell
python3 CVE-2023-23488.py http://127.0.0.1/wordpress
```
